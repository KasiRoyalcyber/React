my ref:

npm:

std repo for all the packages. any packages req for the project

when you make create react app, automatically npm will be inside it.

do npm init

package.json:

^ and ~ in this (carat , tilde)
carat - parcel will upgrade to minor version automatically
tilde - major version automatically

it is the configuration for npm
this packages also known as dependencies
npm manages that in the package.json


impt package is bundler - bundles the app (shift to production)

CRA - uses webpack bundler.
here we use parcel - npm install -D parcel (two dependency are there. 1. dev 2. normal)
1. dev - req for development phase
2. normal - used in production


package-lock.json:

keep track of exact version of the package
integrity - hash  (keep track of all the versions of dependencies)


node_module:

contain all the code that we fetch from npm
collection of dependencies
